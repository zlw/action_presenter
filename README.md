# ActionPresenter [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/zlw/action_presenter.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/zlw/action_presenter)

Missing link between models and views.
Use presenter pattern in Rails application without changing controllers.

**Based on *'Presenters from Scratch'* by Ryan Bates.**

## Installation

**Add `action_presenter` to Gemfile**

```ruby
gem 'action_presenter'
# or
gem 'action_presenter', git: 'git@github.com:zlw/action_presenter.git'
```

**and than install**

```bash
# for RSpec
rails generate action_presenter:intall -t rspec

# for Test::Unit
rails generate action_presenter:install -t test_unit
```

Gem was tested under Ruby 1.9.2 and 1.9.3, Rails 3.2.1

## Usage

### Creating presenter class

```ruby
# /app/presenters/post_presenter.rb
class PostPresenter < ActionPresenter::Base
  presents :post

  def title
    link_to_unless_current post.title, post_path(post), class: :post_title_link
  end

  def content
    content_tag :pre, post.content
  end
end
```

You can use all view helpers without any changes. Reference to model by method with the name passed to `presents` class method.

### Calling presenter

```haml
# /app/views/posts/index.html.haml
- present @post do |p|
  = p.title
  = p.content
```

It will call (by default) `PostPresenter` (assuming that @post variable is instance of Post class)

There are some ways to change default presenter class

#### 1. Pass class as second argument

```ruby
present @post, ArticlePresenter
```

It will call `ArticlePresenter` class

#### 2. Scope variable

```ruby
present [:admin, @post]
```

It will call `Admin::PostPresenter` class

**Please, keep in mind, that passing presenter class has higher priority than scope:**

```ruby
present [:admin, @post], ArticlePresenter
```

**It will also call `ShowPostPresenter` class**

## Defaults

There're some default presenter methods. They're generated if object respond to those methods

### `created_at` and `updated_at`

```haml
- present @article do |p|
 = p.created_at #=> "February 17, 2012 12:30"
 = p.updated_at #=> "February 17, 2012 13:27"
```

It's also possible to change timestamps format

```haml
- present @article do |p|
  = p.created_at :short
  = p.updated_at :long
```

## Utilities

### Let

There's RSpec inspired way to define methods

```ruby
class ArticlePresenter < ActionPresenter::Base
  presents :article

  let(:link_to_title) { link_to_unless_current article.title, article_path(article) }

  let(:render_article) do
    html = ''.html_safe

    html += content_tag :h1, article.title
    html += content_tag :p, article.content

    html
  end
end
```

## Testing

### RSpec

```ruby
require 'spec_helper'

describe ArticlePresenter do
  include ActionView::TestCase::Behavior

  let(:article) { mock_model(Article) }
  let(:presenter) { ArticlePresenter.new(article, view) }
end
```

You can change RSpec configuration to include `ActionView::TestCase::Behavior` in all specs in `/spec/presenters` folder

```ruby
RSpec.configure do |config|
  # a lot of code here ...

  config.include ActionView::TestCase::Behavior, example_group: { file_path: %r{spec/presenters} }
end
```

### Test::Unit

```ruby
require 'test_helper'

class TestArticlePresenter < ActionView::TestCase
end
```
